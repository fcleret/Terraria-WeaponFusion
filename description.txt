Weapon Fusion is a mod that allows the fusion of two identical items of the same level, to increase their level and stats.
To do this, simply right-click on the weapon to be upgraded and it will automatically search the inventory if a match exists.

It's functional with items from mods, however there may be some bugs.
We will do our best to add fixes and features as time goes on.
