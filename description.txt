Weapon Fusion is a mod that allows the fusion of two identical items of the same level, to increase their level and stats.
To do this, simply right-click on the weapon to be upgraded and it will automatically search the inventory if a match exists.

It's functional with items from mods, however there may be some bugs.
We will do our best to add fixes and features as time goes on.


Planned fixes and features:
- Prevent level reset when item is moved out of player's inventory in multiplayer
- Be able to accept reforge stats
- Be able to equip gear with right click when it can no longer be merged
- And more ...
